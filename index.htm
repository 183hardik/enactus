    Project Asbah aims to provide clean drinking water to underprivileged communities which are plagued by the lack of accessibility or affordability for potable drinking water. We provide water at Rs. 4 - Rs. 6 for 20 litres by setting up community water filtration plants in urban slums and rural households.
Water is dispensed through water ATM structures with the help of rechargeable digitised Asbah cards. 
Each Asbah plant also generates livelihood opportunities for 2 women entrepreneurs from members of the community who act as the operators of the plant. 
Asbah has now been able to set up 18 plants which impact 46,750+ people every single <br>

    Project Virasat is an umbrella organisation that aims to revive the age old craft-forms of India. We started our journey by establishing P-TAL in an effort to revive the dying art form of handcrafting copper and brass utensils using hammering techniques, by mobilising artisans and providing them access to organised credit, contemporary designs and better demand avenues. Now, we plan to make Project Virasat a launchpad to provide opportunities to millions of craftsmen across India who are currently struggling to carry on their . <br>

    Amal aims at minimizing the catastrophic impact of stubble burning by converting them into eco-friendly biomass briquettes which can be effectively used to replace traditional source of energy such as charcoal, firewood etc.
Contrasted with different resources of vitality, briquettes have a higher calorific value per rupee paid and low powder content, thus making an environment friendly substitute to coal. <br><br><br>
